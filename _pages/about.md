Hi!

I am currently a first-year Ph.D student in physics at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). 

I have a broad interest in cosmology, particle physics, and data analysis. I'm interested in modeling large-scale strucutre to better extract cosmological information using different approaches such as exploring extensions to LCDM model, investing cross probes, studying higher order statistics, and most recently, machine learning. I'm a member of the Dark Energy Survey(DES) and Rubin Observatory's Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). The code for my projects and notes on various topics are all publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KunhaoZhong).

I obtained my M.A in physics at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) with advisory from [Vivian Miranda](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/people/_profiles/mirandav). Prior to that, I completed my B.S in phyiscs at [UT-Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) under the supervision of [Kim Boddy](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/4373-boddy-kimberly-kay?Itemid=349) and [Richard Matzner](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/18-physics/449-matzner-richard-a?Itemid=349).
