Hi!

I am a second year M.A student in physics at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). 

I'm broadly interested in cosmology, particle physics, and astrophysics. My research now with Dr. Vivian Miranda focuses on cosmological models beyond LCDM, using various data sets from large scale strucutre to CMB. I'm also very interested in modeling large-scale strucutre to better extract cosmological information in the upcoming era of Stave-IV survey. I'm a member of Dark Energy Survey(DES) and Rubin Observatory's Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). The code for my projects and notes on various topics are all publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KunhaoZhong).

I completed my B.S in phyiscs at [UT-Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), under the supervision of [Kim Boddy](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/4373-boddy-kimberly-kay?Itemid=349), and [Richard Matzner](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/18-physics/449-matzner-richard-a?Itemid=349).
