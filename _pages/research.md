Growth and Geometry Split in Light of DES-Y3 Survey
---------------------------------------------------
In the LCDM and models that only modifies the expansion history, the overdensity of matter evolve in the same way as the background, characterized by the growth function. The evolution equation of the growth function only denpends on the matter density today in LCDM. However, that is not true in any modified gravity and dark energy clustering or coupled to dark matter model. We test this relation by introducing a meta parameter that doesn't enter into the geometry but growth of the LCDM and wCDM model. We carefully chose the geometry prior such that the constraining power only comes from DES data, and found no inconsistency between growth and geometry.





Marginalizing EDE Predictions over Late Expansion
-------------------------------------------------
The Early Dark Energy(EDE) is a promising solution to the current Hubble tension. The simplest model of EDE however is inconsistent with the current large-scale structure data. We marginalize the late time expansion rate and test with different data set to see if a late time modification can save the EDE model.



Micro-physics of Dark Energy: Anisotropic Stress and Sound Speed
----------------------------------------------------------------
In the fluid description of dark energy, the perturbation is usually turned off artificially due to gravitational instability. In Post-Friedmann(PPF) prescription the problem was solved by a gauge transform and match the dark energy perturbation to that of dark matter at large scale. The anisotropic stress part of this description is often ignored, and in this study we use the latest large-scale structure data along with CMB anistropy at large scale to constrain the shear term. We also studied other phenomenological model of anisotropic stress and scaler field model that introduce sound speed.
